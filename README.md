# Thermodynamic modelling of post-LGM pressure-temperature conditions in the northeastern Barents Sea

Code to solve the one-dimensional englacial and subglacial temperature evolution model presented in the article *Extensive glacitectonism and rapid deglacial fluid expulsion in the northeastern Barents Sea* submitted by Montelli et al.

The python code needed to run the model is included.

All code runs in Python 3.9 and usually would require some modules to be installed before they can be imported.

### Downloading and running the code

The easiest way to run this code is via Jupyter Notebook.
